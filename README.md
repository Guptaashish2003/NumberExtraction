## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-detection-project.git
cd car-detection-project

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
On Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies

Make sure requirements.txt is present and then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    If you don't have a requirements.txt, you can generate one with:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the project:

jupyter notebook

Then open Car_Detection_Project_Final.ipynb.
